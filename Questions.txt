I have a question about images: Sometimes the "<img" tag is closed with ">", sometimes with "/>". What is the difference?

----------------------
In "CODE-ALONG: Layout and Hyperlinks" I found that the only way to make the page the correct width was to add
max-width: 900px;
twice to the <body> tag. Slightly puzzled, as I've typed it correctly both times (It also worked if I copied and pasted into the line below, just to make sure I wasn't typing it incorrectly in one line). My body tag looks like this:

body {
    background-color: #fef9ff;
    font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;
    color: #0d1f2d
	max-width: 900px;
	max-width: 900px;
    margin: 0 auto;
}

-----------------------
Hi, another query: I have hit a similar snag to Margaret Z above. When I place the following code within <style> tags in the index page (and have addded <div style="clear-float"></div> to the end of each "article"). Or, if I add it to the css file

.clear-float {
clear:both;
}
	
article img {
float:left;
}

I get a page where the images float, but the float isn't cleared (the example shows them floating but also with the next image correctly formatted on a new line). Is there something I might be missing?

Thanks
